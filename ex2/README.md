Certainly! Below is a basic Python code using the Paho MQTT client library to connect to an MQTT server and subscribe to the topic "#control". Before running the code, make sure you have the `paho-mqtt` library installed, which you can install using pip (`pip install paho-mqtt`).

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Define MQTT broker address and port
broker_address = "mqtt.example.com"
port = 1883  # Default MQTT port

# Define callback functions for MQTT events
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
    # Subscribe to the topic "#control" when connected
    client.subscribe("#control")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print("Received message: "+msg.topic+" "+str(msg.payload))

# Create an MQTT client instance
client = mqtt.Client()

# Set callback functions
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the MQTT broker
client.connect(broker_address, port, 60)

# Loop to maintain connection and process incoming messages
client.loop_forever()
```

In this code:

- Replace `"mqtt.example.com"` with the address of your MQTT broker.
- The `on_connect()` function is called when the client connects to the broker. It subscribes to the topic "#control" in this case.
- The `on_message()` function is called whenever a message is received on any of the subscribed topics. In this example, it simply prints out the received message.
- The client connects to the MQTT broker using the specified address and port.
- Finally, the `loop_forever()` function is called to start the client's network loop, which maintains the connection to the broker and processes incoming messages indefinitely.

You may need to add error handling and additional logic depending on your specific requirements and use case.
